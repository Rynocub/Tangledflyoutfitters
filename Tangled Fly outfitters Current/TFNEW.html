    <h1>Guided Fly Fishing Float Trips</h1>
      <P class="Line">
        Float trips are considered one of our premier fishing experiences. Beginners and experienced clients can enjoy a less crowded, aesthetic, and scenic fishing environment. With miles of river to float, it is not unusual to catch a large number of trout and perhaps even a trophy-sized Brown or
         Rainbow! Float trips use the Watauga, South Holston, Tuckaseegee, and Catawba Tailwaters via are rafts. Smallmouth and Muskie fishing on the French Broad River
         is also available depending on the water conditions.
        Float trips typically leave around 7:30am with 4 hours on the water for half-day trips and 6 hours on the water for full-day trips. This does not include travel times. Trips finish no later than 4:00pm on full days.

  <h1>Guided Fly Fishing Wade Trips</h1>
      <P class="Line">
        Wade trips allow clients the most flexibility in terms of time and distance traveled to fish some of our area's best local freestone trout waters in the Pisgah National Forest and North Carolina Wildlife-Designated Delayed-Harvest streams. Many of these streams support wild Brown, Rainbow, and Brook trout populations. We can customize your trip for a morning, afternoon, or full-day quality fishing experience. Half-day and full-day wade trips are also available to the South Holston and Watauga rivers in Eastern Tennessee.
  Wade trips typically leave around 7:30am with 4 hours on the water for half-day trips and 6 hours on the water for full-day trips. This does not include travel times. Trips finish no later than 4:00pm on full days.

    <h2>What you need to Know</h2>
    <p class="Know-Text">Fly fishing in our area is good all year so donâ€™t put away your fishing gear just because it gets colder. When planning your trip check the extended weather forecast as you will need to dress appropriately for the time and season.
       Bring a change of clothes, sunscreen, polarized sunglasses, hat, rain jacket and camera.
      Please advise us if you are allergic to insects or have medical concerns and bring all necessary medications with you.
      If you do not have your own equipment or choose to use ours, we will provide a rod, reel, waders, and boots. Snacks and refreshments are provided on all trips. Terminal tackle such as leaders and flies, your license, and gratuity are not included in our rates.
Licenses may be purchased ahead of time by calling or going online to the North Carolina Wildlife (888-248-6834) and Tennessee Wildlife licensing agencies. Any angler 12 and over must know their social
 security number to get a license in Tennessee.
 One Fly Outfitters, Ltd. operates year-round offering both wade and float fly-fishing trips to some of the best trout fishing destinations in Western North Carolina and Eastern Tennessee.
<br><br><br>
We are insured and operate under special commercial use permits in the Pisgah National Forest. We are a catch-and-release outfitter.
From October to the first Saturday in June, Delayed-Harvest Regulations allow catch-and-release trout fishing using only flies or artificial lures with one hook. No fish are ever taken from the stream. This offers our anglers some great fishing opportunities on specially designated streams in Western North Carolina.
After the first Saturday in June, all Delayed-Harvest streams revert back to Hatchery Supported Regulations. These, along with our wild and catch-and-release regulated waters, offer anglers some good summer and fall fishing until Delayed-Harvest starts up again in October.
Please call ahead when planning your trip to check available dates and make a reservation. A 50% deposit is required when booking a trip to reserve both a date and guide. We will refund deposits if notified within 7 days of the trip.
    </p>
    <h2>Fly Fishing instructions</h2>
    <p class="Know-Text">
      This is the best one day instructional program for learning to fly fish! It involves one on one personalized instruction in the morning learning the knots, gear selection, entomology, fly selection, and casting techniques. In the afternoon you will be on the stream involved with reading the water, wading strategies, and putting everything you have learned into action catching fish. Rod, reel, waders, and boots are provided.
      For beginners who have started to fly fish and need to cover the cas ting techniques more in depth, we offer Fly Casting Instruction. It includes instruction on the basic distance cast, roll cast, and special casting situations.
    </p>
    <h3>Fly tying Instruction/program Info</h3>
    <p class="Know-Text">

      One Fly Outfitters, Ltd. offers to tie as a service to our customers, special custom fly patterns. Minimum orders must not be less than a dozen flies. Prices vary depending on the fly pattern chosen. This is a good opportunity to get some of your special hard to get, local, or custom patterns tied for you.

    </p>
    <h3>Specialty Fly Selection</h3>
    <p class="Know-Text">
      Planning a trip to our Mountains or the Tennessee Tailwaters? Why not have us prepare an assortment of flies for these locations. We can prepare a selection of flies, with or without a fly box, and can either ship this to you or hold for pickup. Contact store for further details and pricing.
This is a great gift idea!
